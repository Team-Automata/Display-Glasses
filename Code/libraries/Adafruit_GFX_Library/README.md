# Adafruit GFX Library
**Version 1.2.2** - [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.). It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
